Quantum GIS (QGIS) is a user friendly Geographic Information System
that lets you view and manipulate spatial data on your computer.  It 
supports many common spatial data formats (e.g. PostGIS, ShapeFile and
geotiff).

gdal should be built after python3 has been installed to ensure that the proper
Python 3 bindings are available.

Optional compile-time dependencies: 
 - postgresql and postgis: for PostGIS support
 - gpsbabel: for the GPS plugin
 - grass: for the Grass plugin
 - gsl: for georeferencing support
 - fcgi: for the QGIS server (see README.server)

Optional run-time dependencies:
 - OTB
 - R
 - saga-gis
 - TauDEM

If ninja is installed, set NINJA=yes to use it for parallel builds that should
be faster on most systems.
